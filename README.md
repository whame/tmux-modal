tmux-modal
==========

Execute complex tmux commands in just a few keystrokes. tmux-modal introduces a
modal mode (e.g. like in Vim text editor) in tmux that is designed to be
efficient, easy to remember and comfortable.

## Examples

Hit `M-m` (`Alt-m` in tmux terminology) first to enter the modal command mode.
The status bar will show `[=]` to indicate that we are now in the modal mode
(hit `M-m` again to exit back to "normal" mode). Here are some quick examples
what one can do with tmux-modal (see the [keybindings](#keybindings) for a
complete list).

**Navigation**

Easily move between panes and windows:

- `w l` to select the right pane
- `w j` to select the pane below
- `w 1` to select window 1
- `w o` to go back to other/last windows

**Management**

Create and delete windows with a breeze. Split, delete, zoom, move and break
panes and much more in just a few keystrokes:

- `w c` to create a new window
- `w D` to  delete window
- `w s k` to  split window pane right
- `w s j` to  split window pane below
- `w d` to delete a pane
- `w z` to zoom in/out of a pane

**Sticky commands**

Use sticky commands to do more, repeatedly. Sticky commands enters a _specific_
modal mode with specialized keybindings (see [keybindings](#keybindings) for a
more detailed explanation and a full list of available commands).

Hit `w w` to enter sticky window command:

- `s j` to split window pane below
- `k` to select the above pane
- `d` to delete a pane
- `c` to create window
- `0` to select window 0

Hit `w r` to enter sticky resize window command:

- `k` to resize the window pane one step upwards
- `l` to resize the window pane one step to the right
- `J` to resize the window pane multiple steps downwards
- `H` to resize the window pane multiple steps to the left

## Install

### Tmux Plugin Manager

Using [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) is the
recommended way to install tmux-modal. Just add it as a plugin in your
`~/.tmux.conf`:

```
set -g @plugin 'whame/tmux-modal'
```

Then hit `prefix` + `I` to install it (see the documentaion for Tmux Plugin
Manager for more details).

### Manually

You can also clone and manually install tmux-modal. Put this at the end of your
`~/.tmux.conf`:

```
run /path/to/cloned/tmux-modal/tmux-modal.tmux
```

Note however that in this case you have to manually sync the cloned repository
in order to get bug fixes, new features etc.

Note that the sticky window command (`w w`) allows one to execute all of the
above commands in the table but without the initial `w`. For example, after
hitting `w w`, `s l` splits the window pane to the right, `d` deletes the window
pane, `h` selects the left pane and so on (`q` exits the sticky command). Also
see the option [`@modal-always-sticky`](#always-sticky-command) if you instead
always want to use the sticky command version (with only hitting `w` once).

## Customization

### Custom keybindings

The option `@modal-keybindings-conf` can be set to load custom keybindings. The
file `keybindings.conf` shows the default keybindings and can be used as a
template. Thus, copy the file and modify it to your liking, and finally set this
in your `.tmux.conf` to load them:

```
set -g @modal-keybindings-conf /path/to/my-tmux-modal-keybindings.conf
```

### Yes/no prompt

Some commands might be too "dangerous" to execute directly, for example `w d`
(`kill-pane`) or `w D` (`kill-window`). The option `@modal-yesno-cmd` can
therefore be used to ask for confirmation before executing the commands (to
mimic the default tmux behavior). If you want a yes/no prompt before executing
these commands, put this in `.tmux.conf`:

```
set -g @modal-yesno-cmd on
```

### Start with modal command mode

The option `@modal-on-start` can be used to automatically enter the modal
command mode on a new tmux session. If you always want to start a new session
with the modal command mode, add the following to `.tmux.conf`:

```
set -g @modal-on-start on
```

### Always sticky command

The option `@modal-always-sticky` can be specified to always use the sticky
version instead of manually entering the sticky command first (e.g. `w w` for
sticky window command):

```
set -g @modal-always-sticky on
```

For example, with this in `.tmux.conf`, one only has to press `w` once and the
sticky window command mode will be entered directly. That is, after hitting `w`
once, you can now directly use `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` to select the window panes
(or any other window commands). Don't forget to exit the sticky command with
`q`.

### Show command keys in status bar

The option `@modal-show-cmd-keys` can be set in `.tmux.conf` to give immediate
feedback in the status bar during tmux-modal command sequences:

```
set -g @modal-show-cmd-keys on
```

The left status bar will now update to match the tmux-modal command currently in
use. For example, if you press `w` the status bar will change from the modal
command icon `[=]` to `[w]` (the window command). If you now further press `s`,
it will update to `[ws]` to signify the split window command sequence and so on.

### Add Options to Split Command

The option `@modal-split-opts` can be set in `.tmux.conf` to give allow control
over options passed to split:

```
