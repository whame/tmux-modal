# These are the default keybindings for tmux-modal. This file will be used
# (sourced) by the main script `tmux-modal.tmux` when tmux loads. Users can
# however load their own custom keybindings file by copying this file, make any
# changes and then tell tmux-modal to load the custom file instead with tmux
# option `modal-keybindings-conf`. For example, put this is in your
# `.tmux.conf`:
#
#     set -g @modal-keybindings-conf /path/to/my-tmux-modal-keybindings.conf
#
# The syntax is the same as for tmux keybindings:
#
#     KBD_CMD_EXIT=Escape
#     KBD_WIN_RESIZE_UP=S-Up
#     KBD_GOTO_WIN_NEXT=C-n
#     KBD_GOTO_SESS_PREV=M-p
#
# This binds `Esc`, `Shift-Up`, `Ctrl-n` and `Alt-p`, to `KBD_CMD_EXIT` (exit
# modal command mode), `KBD_WIN_RESIZE_UP` (window resize up),
# `KBD_GOTO_WIN_NEXT` (go to next window) and `KBD_GOTO_SESS_PREV` (go to
# previous session), respectively.
#
# Each keybinding variable below has an accompanying comment line. Comment lines
# that starts with a single '#' are "root" commands. Two '#'s means that this is
# a "sub-command" to the previous root command. Three '#'s means that it is a
# sub-command to the previous sub-command, and so on. If a 'q' is followed by a
# '#' in the comment line, it indicates that this command is "sticky", i.e. it
# needs to be exited explicitly (with `KBD_QUIT`).
#
# For example, `KBD_WIN_GOTO_1` is a sub-command to `KBD_WIN` and is used with
# `w 1`. `KBD_PASTE` can be used directly after entering the modal mode, i.e.
# `M-m y`. While `KBD_WIN_RESIZE_RIGHT` is used with `w r l` and is a sticky
# command (since `KBD_WIN_RESIZE`'s comment line is `##q`) and must be exited
# with 'q' (see the `README` for more details).
